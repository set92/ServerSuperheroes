ServerSuperheroes
=================

Server superheroes is the backend part of a game that we have been developing as a PoC. We are doing it GPLv3 Affero
because we understand that with that licensing, we will be able to create a good application, and any improvements will
be available to the public.

What does it do
---------------
The idea is that the server will provide a REST API, allowing the users update their data and interact with the game.

API
---

/api/v1/user/
POST - Create user
PUT  - Update location
